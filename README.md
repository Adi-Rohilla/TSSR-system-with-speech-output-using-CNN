Traffic sign and signal recognition (TSSR) represents an important feature of advanced driver assistance systems, contributing to the safety of the drivers, pedestrians and vehicles as well. We propose an approach for traffic sign and signal detection based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).We first transform the original image into the gray scale image by using support vector machines, then use convolutional neural networks with fixed and learnable layers for detection and recognition. The fixed layer can reduce the amount of interest areas to detect, and crop the boundaries very close to the borders of traffic signs. The learnable layers can increase the accuracy of detection significantly.
